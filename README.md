I deployed a simple web app on AWS using EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to maintain availability. An Auto Scaling Group automatically adds or removes instances based on CPU usage, ensuring performance during high load and cost efficiency during low traffic.
